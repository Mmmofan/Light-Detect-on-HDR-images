# Light-Detect-on-HDR-images

School project

This is post-process when the stereo cameras are calibrated through my last repository

This can detect the main light on the dark background, and ignore the small ones

But I also believe it has drawbacks if used in some pictures which has so many light areas, so it's just a sample

The algorithm of detect the light is self-design and some parameters can be fixed(I cannot give a guide to adjust these parameters)

Any suggestion or advice is welcomed

I'm a new conqueror of coding, hope I can do bette
